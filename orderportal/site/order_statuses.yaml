# OrderPortal order status definitions.

# Remove any unwanted statuses before deploying your site.

# Removing statuses from a deployed site is a bad idea:
# Orders and order histories in the database will become corrupt.

# Statuses may be added after a site has been deployed.

# This file is read on server startup, so a restart is required 
# whenever it has been modified.
